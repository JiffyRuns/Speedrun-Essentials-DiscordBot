# Setting Up Your Bot
The first thing you're going to want to do is create a new discord app, you can do that by clicking this link:
https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me

Press "New App" set-up a name and save it.

Now scroll down and press "Create a Bot User".

Then confirm the popup and click the blue text to reveal your bot token.

Now navigate to the BotToken.txt file that came with the download and paste your token onto the second line.

Then, you're going to want to visit (replacing the "INSERTTOKENHERE" part of the URL with your token) https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=INSERTYOURTOKENHERE&permissions=0&scope=bot

Invite the bot to your discord, launch the SpeedrunsEssentialDiscordBot.exe file and enjoy!
